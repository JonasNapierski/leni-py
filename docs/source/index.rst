Welcome to Leni-py's documentation!
===================================

Welcome to our open-source project! We are thrilled to introduce you to our revolutionary local AI â€“ a modular and powerful alternative to Siri.

Our AI has been meticulously designed to understand and respond to text commands, bringing an entirely new level of convenience and intelligence to your fingertips. Inspired by the beauty of open-source collaboration, we believe that every user should have the opportunity to personalize and extend the capabilities of their AI assistant.

With its modular architecture, you can easily customize and expand the AI's functionalities to suit your specific needs. Whether you want to integrate it into your smart home system, build your own chatbot, or explore the possibilities of machine learning â€“ the potential is limitless.

Best of all, our AI is designed to prioritize privacy and data security. Your personal information stays on your local device, ensuring that you have complete control over your data.

We invite you to join our community of passionate developers, contributors, and users who are shaping the future of this project. Together, let's build a smarter, more accessible AI that can enrich the lives of people worldwide.

Welcome aboard, and let's embark on this exciting journey of innovation and collaboration! Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–
